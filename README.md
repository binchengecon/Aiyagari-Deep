# Aiyagari-Deep


We solve Aiyagri model with Poisson income process with a neural network as an example, written in Python.



Before running the code, please install the supporting package, NumPy, Tensorflow and Matplotlib


One can easily execute by


* pip install -r requirement.txt



For step-by-step illustration please open"Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.ipynb".

For results only,

1. Make "/Aiyagari-Deep/" the current working directory
2. Execute command in terminal or command window "python Aiyagari-Deep_Poisson.py"
